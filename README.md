# Platform Integration and Orchestration Scripting

This repository contains Python code for AWS Lambda functions designed for platform integration and orchestration purposes. These scripts are intended to automate and streamline various tasks related to managing resources and integrating with external services within an AWS environment.

## Files



## Deployment

To deploy these Lambda functions, follow these steps:

1. Package the Python code and any dependencies into a ZIP file.
2. Upload the ZIP file to an S3 bucket.
3. Create a new Lambda function in the AWS Management Console.
4. Configure the Lambda function with the appropriate runtime, handler function, and permissions.
5. Trigger the Lambda function using an appropriate event source, such as an SNS topic or API Gateway endpoint.

## Usage

Once deployed, these Lambda functions can be invoked manually or automatically based on events in the AWS environment. They can be used to automate tasks such as resource provisioning, data processing, and system monitoring, enhancing the efficiency and reliability of your AWS workflows.

## Notes

- Ensure that the Lambda functions have the necessary IAM permissions to interact with AWS services and external APIs.
- Monitor the execution of the Lambda functions using CloudWatch Logs and Metrics to ensure they are performing as expected.
- Update the Python code as needed to meet the specific requirements of your integration and orchestration workflows.
